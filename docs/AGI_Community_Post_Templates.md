### Reddit Post 1 — Value-First / Question Hook
**Title:** Does anyone track gold prices in African currencies? I built something for this.

**Body:**
I've been frustrated for a while that all gold price data online is in USD. If you're actually buying, selling, or storing gold in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, or anywhere else in Africa, you need to convert everything manually — and the exchange rates keep changing.

So I put together a free weekly newsletter that publishes gold prices (24K, 22K, 18K) converted into 15 African currencies, along with global market hours, trend notes, and formulas for calculating real buying/selling rates.

It's called **Africa Gold Intelligence** and it's 100% free.

If you've been doing this conversion manually every week, this might save you some time: [africagoldintelligence.com](https://www.africagoldintelligence.com)

Happy to answer any questions about how the prices are calculated.

### Reddit Post 2 — Data/Insight Hook
**Title:** Gold hit [CURRENT PRICE] per troy oz this week — here's what that means in naira, cedis & shillings

**Body:**
Gold is sitting at around $[PRICE]/oz this week (as of [DATE]).

For anyone trading or buying in Africa, here's a rough breakdown:

- 🇳🇬 Nigeria (NGN): ~₦[AMOUNT] per gram (24K)
- 🇬🇭 Ghana (GHS): ~₵[AMOUNT] per gram (24K)
- 🇰🇪 Kenya (KES): ~KSh[AMOUNT] per gram (24K)

*(Rates based on current FX)*

I publish these every week across 15 currencies + 22K and 18K grades in my free newsletter **Africa Gold Intelligence**. If this kind of breakdown is useful, subscribe here: [africagoldintelligence.com](https://www.africagoldintelligence.com)

### Reddit Post 3 — Community Ask
**Title:** Anyone else track gold prices across African markets? Looking to connect

**Body:**
I run a small weekly newsletter focused on gold prices for African traders and investors — I convert live gold prices into 15 African currencies each week (naira, cedis, shillings, francs, etc.) across 24K, 22K, and 18K.

Curious if there are others in this community who track gold in local African currencies. What tools or sources do you use?

For context, I started this because the gap between USD gold prices and local currency prices costs traders real money when they're not tracking FX properly. Newsletter is free: [africagoldintelligence.com](https://www.africagoldintelligence.com)

### Facebook Post 2 — Story/Problem Hook
A friend of mine buys gold in Accra and resells it. Every Monday he manually checks the spot price in USD, then pulls up a currency converter, then tries to calculate his margin.

One wrong exchange rate and his profit margin disappears.

I built **Africa Gold Intelligence** to solve exactly this — a free weekly newsletter that converts live gold prices into 15 African currencies automatically, so traders and investors always have the right numbers.

If you or someone you know deals in gold, this is for you: www.africagoldintelligence.com

### Facebook Post 3 — Engagement Post (Poll/Question)
Quick question for gold traders and investors in Africa 👇

When you check the gold price, what currency do you track it in?

🇺🇸 USD (dollar price only)
🇳🇬 NGN / 🇬🇭 GHS / 🇰🇪 KES (local currency)
📊 Both — I do the conversion myself

If you answered "both" or "local currency" — we built something for you.
